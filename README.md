# Classroom Blog

A platform for teachers to have their students blog.  Originally designed for use in beginner programming classes, to introduce the students to Markdown, blogging, and interacting with blogs.  It provides them with a way of synthesizing what they are learning and helps them see things from multiple points of view as their fellow students begin to understand things.  Created on top of Django.

## Features

- Each Blog has a home page.

## Future/Possible Features

 - Teacher can have multiple classrooms
 - Each classroom can have multiple students with a single blog each
 - Each student should have a homepage (that they can self style?)
 - Each student (and teacher) should be able to post blog posts
 - These posts should show up on the student's homepage as well as the class's home page
 - Students (and teachers) should be able to comment on each others' posts
 - Posts should be renderable from markdown (and others?  rst?  html?)
 - Posts should have tags?
 - Teacher should be able to assign a frequency of posts and track the students' progress (i.e. see which students posted in a specified timeframe)
 - Posts should have a publish date so that drafting is possible.

## Installation and Operation

## Contributions

I'm super open to help.  I would almost say it might be a good idea to lay out a rough skeleton of your changes and open the pull request up front so we can talk about it before you do a bunch of work.  

## Code of Conduct

Obviously the code of conduct comes down to the "Don't Be a Fartknuckle" System:tm:.  To get a good feel for what it means to Not Be a Fartknuckle, check out the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct).  If you have any problems, don't hesitate to let me know.  If I give you problems, ditto, but additionally make sure you call me a Fartknuckle.
